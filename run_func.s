#PURPOSE: Program to illustrate how functions work
# This program will compute the value of
# 2^3 + 5^2 = 27 + 25 = 52
#

#Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
#so the data section doesnâ€™t have anything.

#PURPOSE: This function is used to compute
# the value of a number raised to
# a power.
#
#INPUT: First argument - the base number
# Second argument - the power to
# raise it to
#
#OUTPUT: Will give the result as a return value
#
#NOTES: The power must be 1 or greater
#
#VARIABLES:
# %ebx - holds the base number
# %ecx - holds the power
#
# -4(%ebp) - holds the current result
#
# %eax is used for temporary storage
